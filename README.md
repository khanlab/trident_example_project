# Example Project

This Example project is to demonstrate a proposed filesystem organization, which has top-level folders by modality, then sub-folders separating sourcedata, bids, and derivatives.  

The combined dataset should have a bids dataset that uses symlinks to reference other modalities, but provides a common integrated location for bids data across modalities

Note: Each top-level folder is intentionally Nipoppy-like (https://nipoppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), though formal adherence to it may be challenging for all types of data beyond MRI.
